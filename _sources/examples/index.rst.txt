Examples
========

This section contains domain-specific tutorials that go beyond the basics covered in Getting Started. Each example demonstrates a complete simulation scenario — from AWGN Monte Carlo analysis to OFDM, MIMO, and optical fiber systems — and can serve as a starting point for your own experiments.

The example scripts are also available on GitHub: `https://github.com/vincentchoqueuse/comnumpy/tree/main/examples <https://github.com/vincentchoqueuse/comnumpy/tree/main/examples>`_.
