# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning.

## [Unreleased] — 1.0.0.dev0

Sanitation batch ("Lot 0" of the architecture document): no new feature,
but the published package becomes consistent with what the code actually does.

### Fixed

- `README.md` quick example now runs as written (the previous example called a
  non-existent `SymbolMapper(M=16)` signature and unpacked two return values
  from `Sequential`, which returns one).
- `optical.channels.PhaseNoise` was dead code: it raised `AttributeError` at
  construction (missing `seed` field) and called a non-existent `self.rvs()`.
  It now works and is seedable.
- `core.compensators.TrainedBasedComplexGainCompensator` was not functional
  (invalid dataclass field declarations, `fit()` referencing undefined
  variables). Rewritten; the estimated gain is verified numerically.
- `core.compensators.TrainedBasedPhaseCompensator.__post__init__` typo: the
  initializer was never called. Renamed to `__post_init__`.
- `ofdm.processors.CarrierAllocator` raised on 1D input when pilots were
  present; pilots now broadcast correctly along the allocation axis for 1D
  and N-D inputs.
- `ofdm.utils.get_standard_carrier_allocation` always nulled an odd number of
  DC subcarriers (`2*(N//2)+1`), and nulled one subcarrier even when
  `N_nulled_DC=0` (the `NoPilot_Full_*` configurations were not full).
  Exactly `N_nulled_DC` subcarriers are now nulled.
- `mimo.channels.BaseMIMOChannel.info()` crashed on `H.ndims` (typo for `ndim`).
- `mimo.utils.rayleigh_channel` / `rician_channel` used an undefined `shape`
  variable in their tap loop.
- `core.monitors` referenced `compute_PAPR` without importing it.
- All failing doctests (48 failing examples at the 2026-07-28 audit): every
  documented numeric value is now the value the code actually computes, with
  explicit seeds where randomness is involved. Doctests are executed in CI
  and block the build.
- `ofdm.utils.plot_carrier_allocation`: mutable default arguments removed;
  the documented color/label defaults no longer contradict the signature.
- Importing comnumpy no longer mutates global matplotlib state
  (`rcParams['agg.path.chunksize']`).

### Changed

- Dependencies are now `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` only. `seaborn`
  (used once, for a KDE plot now implemented with `scipy.stats.gaussian_kde`)
  and `tqdm` (never used) are removed.
- Version numbering restarts above the highest version ever published on PyPI
  (0.91): this development line is `1.0.0.dev0` and will be released as
  `1.0.0`. The previously planned `v0.2.0` would have been a PEP 440
  regression invisible to `pip install -U`.
- CI now tests Python 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13, runs doctests and `ruff`, and
  enforces a coverage ratchet (the measured coverage becomes the floor).
- `requirements.txt` removed; use `pip install .[dev]` extras instead.

### Removed

- `src/comnumpy/optical/chains.py` (empty file).
