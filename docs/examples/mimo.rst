MIMO Chain Tutorial
===================

This tutorial demonstrates how to simulate a basic MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) communication system using the ``comnumpy`` library. You will learn how to:

- Build a MIMO simulation chain with Rayleigh fading.
- Visualize received and equalized signals.
- Compare detection algorithms (ZF, MMSE, OSIC, ML).
- Perform a Monte Carlo evaluation of Symbol Error Rate (SER).

This tutorial is ideal for engineers or students learning about MIMO systems, and offers both practical insights and theoretical understanding.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- ``numpy``
- ``matplotlib``
- ``comnumpy``
- ``tqdm``

Simulation Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Import Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We start by importing the required Python libraries and `comnumpy` components:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/mimo/one_shot_mimo.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 1-14

2. Define System Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We define the number of transmit/receive antennas, the modulation order (PSK), and the noise variance:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/mimo/one_shot_mimo.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 16-24

The modulation alphabet is automatically generated from the given parameters.

3. Build the MIMO Chain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We create a transmission chain consisting of a symbol generator, symbol mapper, and Rayleigh fading channel:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/mimo/one_shot_mimo.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 26-33

This simulates a MIMO transmission over a flat-fading channel with additive Gaussian noise. The received signal can be described by :

.. math ::
    
   \mathbf{y}[n] = \mathbf{H}\mathbf{x}[n] + \mathbf{b}[n]

Visualize the Received Signal
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Let's inspect the received signal on each receive antenna:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/mimo/one_shot_mimo.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 35-47

.. image:: img/monte_carlo_mimo_fig1.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

You should observe that the received signal consists of noisy superpositions of multiple transmitted streams.

5. Zero-Forcing Equalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We now apply Zero-Forcing (ZF) equalization using the pseudo-inverse of the channel matrix:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/mimo/one_shot_mimo.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 50-52

This separates the transmitted streams assuming ideal channel knowledge and no noise contribution. The ZF equalized symbol are given by 

.. math ::
    
   \mathbf{z}[n] = \mathbf{H}^{\dagger}\mathbf{y}[n]


Visualize the Estimated Symbols
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We plot the ZF-equalized symbols:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/mimo/one_shot_mimo.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 53-63

.. image:: img/monte_carlo_mimo_fig2.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

The estimated points should cluster near the ideal constellation points, although some noise remains.

7. Compare Detection Algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We now compare four MIMO detection strategies:


- **ML**: Maximum Likelihood

.. math ::

   \widehat{\mathbf{x}}_{ML}[n] = \arg \min_{\mathbf{x}\in \mathcal{M}^{N_t}}\|\mathbf{y}[n] - \mathbf{H}\mathbf{x}\|^2_2

- **ZF**: Zero-Forcing

.. math ::
   \widehat{\mathbf{x}}_{ZF}[n] &= \boldsymbol \Pi_{\mathcal{M}}(\mathbf{z}[n])\\
   \mathbf{z}[n] &= \mathbf{H}^{\dagger}\mathbf{y}[n]

- **MMSE**: Minimum Mean Square Error

.. math ::
   \widehat{\mathbf{x}}_{MMSE}[n] &= \boldsymbol \Pi_{\mathcal{M}}(\mathbf{z}[n])\\
   \mathbf{z}[n] &= \left(\left(\mathbf{H}^H\mathbf{H}\right)^{-1}+\sigma^2 \mathbf{I}_{N_t}\right)\mathbf{H}^H\mathbf{y}[n]

- **OSIC**: Ordered Successive Interference Cancellation

These detectors are directly implemented in `comnumpy`.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/mimo/one_shot_mimo.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 65-78

Each detector is tested on the same channel realization, and the Symbol Error Rate (SER) is printed. We obtain the following 
outputs:

* detector ZF: ser=0.005
* detector MMSE: ser=0.004
* detector OSIC: ser=0.001
* detector ML: ser=0.0005

8. Monte Carlo Evaluation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get a more reliable estimate of the SER, we run a Monte Carlo simulation.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/mimo/one_shot_mimo.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 80-113

This simulates multiple random channels and noise realizations for a range of SNR values.

9. Plot SER vs SNR
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finally, we plot the SER for each detection scheme as a function of SNR:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/mimo/one_shot_mimo.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 115-124

.. image:: img/monte_carlo_mimo_fig3.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

This figure compares detection methods as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The maximum-likelihood (ML) detector delivers the best performance, albeit at higher computational cost. The OSIC detector performs close to ML.

Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^

This tutorial highlighted:

- How to simulate a MIMO transmission with `comnumpy`.
- How ZF equalization recovers the signal from a multi-stream mixture.
- How various MIMO detectors behave under different SNR conditions.
- Why advanced detection schemes like OSIC and ML outperform linear methods in difficult channel conditions.

With `comnumpy`, you can rapidly prototype, test, and visualize MIMO systems â€” whether for research, teaching, or personal learning.
