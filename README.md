# Comnumpy : A Python Library for Communication System Prototyping and Simulation

A python library containing several Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithms for communication systems, including MIMO, OFDM, and optical fiber simulations.

`comnumpy` is made for **researchers**, **engineers**, and **students** in the field of **digital communications**. It’s ideal for anyone who wants to **simulate and analyze communication systems** without reinventing the wheel.

## Why choose `comnumpy`?

* 🧩 **Modular design**: Build and customize your own communication chains easily.
* ⚡ **Lightweight and efficient**: Around 400 KB of clean, well-structured code, without unnecessary dependencies.
* 📚 **Easy to use**: Clear API, comprehensive documentation, and ready-to-run examples.
* 🤝 **Open to contributions**: Developers are encouraged to add new submodules and extend the core capabilities.

## Prerequisites

All you need is a standard Python >3.11 setup with `numpy` and `scipy`. No need for bulky or domain-specific packages — `comnumpy` is ready to go with minimal setup.
